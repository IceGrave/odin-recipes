    <h2>Garlic and Mushrooms combine!</h2>
    <p>These garlic mushrooms are easy to make by sautéing sliced mushrooms in butter with red wine. Delicious with grilled steaks or on top of toasted bread for a tasty appetizer.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until mushrooms are a light golden brown and liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in basil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low, and pour wine into the skillet. Simmer until wine has mostly evaporated. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
